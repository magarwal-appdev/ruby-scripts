  # MEDIAN
  # ======

  # To find the median of a set of numbers,
  #  - sort your set
  #  - find the number of items in your sorted set
  #  - if your sorted set has an odd number of items
  #    - save the middle number as your median
  #  - otherwise
  #    - find the number to the left of the middle number
  #    - find the number to the right of the middle number
  #    - average the left and right numbers and save it as your median
